# Burroughs

Burroughs is an historical database of places in Lawrence, Kansas with a time-machine experience for the user dialing back exterior and interior views of city blocks, buildings, and businesses through the years, decades, and centuries, with building and business histories as well as public discussion walls tied to each physical location. 

## Get involved

To help, please read the [project issues](https://github.com/burroughsapp/burroughs/issues) and see what interests you. We've got lots of ideas requiring front-end development and back-end development (currently Rails, but we're not married to it).
