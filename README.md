# Burroughs

Burroughs is an historical database of places in Lawrence, Kansas with a time-machine experience for the user dialing back blocks, buildings, and businesses through the years, decades, and centuries.

## Get involved

To help, please read the [project issues](https://github.com/burroughsapp/burroughs/issues) and see what interests you. We've got lots of ideas requiring front-end development and back-end development (currently Rails, but we're not married to it).
